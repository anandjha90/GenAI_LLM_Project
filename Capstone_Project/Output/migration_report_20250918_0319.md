### MySQL Equivalent Procedures and Functions

Below are the equivalent MySQL stored procedures and functions for the provided Oracle PL/SQL procedures and functions.

#### Procedure to Get Monthly Sales

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetMonthlySales(IN p_month INT, IN p_year INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_month,
           SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES
    WHERE MONTH(sale_date) = p_month
      AND YEAR(sale_date) = p_year
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m');
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

Note: In MySQL, we don't need to explicitly declare an OUT parameter for the result set. Instead, we can directly select the data in the procedure.

#### Function to Check Reorder Point for Inventory

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION NeedReorder(p_product_id INT) RETURNS BOOLEAN
BEGIN
    DECLARE qty INT;
    SELECT quantity_in_stock INTO qty
    FROM INVENTORY
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
    IF qty < 100 THEN
       RETURN TRUE;
    ELSE
       RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

#### Sample Business Query: Get Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_purchase
FROM SALES s
JOIN CUSTOMERS c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_purchase DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

Note: In MySQL, we use the `LIMIT` clause instead of `FETCH FIRST` to limit the number of rows returned.

### Example Usage

To call the stored procedure and function, you can use the following queries:

```sql
-- Call the GetMonthlySales procedure
CALL GetMonthlySales(1, 2022);

-- Call the NeedReorder function
SELECT NeedReorder(1) AS need_reorder;
```

Make sure to replace the table and column names with the actual names in your database schema.
```

## bi_sql

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year, 
    MONTH(order_date) AS month, 
    SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
FROM 
    orders
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(order_date), 
    MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY 
    year, month;

SELECT 
    c.customer_name, 
    SUM(oi.quantity * oi.unit_price) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    customers c
JOIN 
    orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id
JOIN 
    order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_name
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;

SELECT 
    p.product_name, 
    p.quantity_in_stock
FROM 
    products p
WHERE 
    p.quantity_in_stock < 100;
```
