### MySQL Equivalent Procedures and Functions

Below are the equivalent MySQL stored procedures and functions for the provided Oracle PL/SQL procedures and functions.

#### Procedure to Get Monthly Sales

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE PROCEDURE GetMonthlySales(IN p_month INT, IN p_year INT)
BEGIN
    SELECT DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m') AS sale_month,
           SUM(total_amount) AS total_sales
    FROM SALES
    WHERE MONTH(sale_date) = p_month
      AND YEAR(sale_date) = p_year
    GROUP BY DATE_FORMAT(sale_date, '%Y-%m');
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

**Note:** MySQL does not support `OUT` parameters for stored procedures like Oracle does. Instead, the result set is returned directly. To call this procedure and retrieve the result set, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
CALL GetMonthlySales(1, 2022);
```

#### Function to Check Reorder Point for Inventory

```sql
DELIMITER //
CREATE FUNCTION NeedReorder(p_product_id INT) RETURNS BOOLEAN
BEGIN
    DECLARE qty INT;
    SELECT quantity_in_stock INTO qty
    FROM INVENTORY
    WHERE product_id = p_product_id;
    IF qty < 100 THEN
       RETURN TRUE;
    ELSE
       RETURN FALSE;
    END IF;
END//
DELIMITER ;
```

**Note:** MySQL does not support `BOOLEAN` as a return type for stored functions. Instead, you can use `TINYINT(1)` or `INT` and return 0 or 1 to represent `FALSE` and `TRUE` respectively. However, in MySQL 8.0 and later, you can use the `BOOLEAN` type.

To call this function, you can use the following syntax:

```sql
SELECT NeedReorder(1);
```

#### Sample Business Query: Get Top 5 Customers by Total Purchase

```sql
SELECT c.customer_name, SUM(s.total_amount) AS total_purchase
FROM SALES s
JOIN CUSTOMERS c ON s.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY c.customer_name
ORDER BY total_purchase DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

**Note:** MySQL uses the `LIMIT` clause to limit the number of rows returned, whereas Oracle uses the `FETCH FIRST` clause.
```

**KPI SQL Queries**
======================

Below are the MySQL SQL queries for the requested KPIs:

### Monthly Sales Trend

This query will return the total sales for each month in the current year.

```sql
SELECT 
    YEAR(order_date) AS year,
    MONTH(order_date) AS month,
    SUM(order_total) AS total_sales
FROM 
    orders
WHERE 
    YEAR(order_date) = YEAR(CURDATE())
GROUP BY 
    YEAR(order_date), 
    MONTH(order_date)
ORDER BY 
    month;
```

### Top 5 Customers by Revenue

This query will return the top 5 customers with the highest total revenue.

```sql
SELECT 
    c.customer_name,
    SUM(o.order_total) AS total_revenue
FROM 
    orders o
JOIN 
    customers c ON o.customer_id = c.customer_id
GROUP BY 
    c.customer_name
ORDER BY 
    total_revenue DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

### Low Stock Products

This query will return all products with a quantity less than 100.

```sql
SELECT 
    p.product_name,
    p.quantity
FROM 
    products p
WHERE 
    p.quantity < 100
ORDER BY 
    p.quantity ASC;
```

**Example Use Case**
--------------------

To use these queries, you would need to replace the table and column names with your actual database schema. For example, if your database has the following schema:

*   `orders` table: `order_id`, `customer_id`, `order_date`, `order_total`
*   `customers` table: `customer_id`, `customer_name`
*   `products` table: `product_id`, `product_name`, `quantity`

You can run these queries in your MySQL database to get the desired KPIs.

**Assumptions**
--------------

*   The `orders` table has a column `order_date` of type `date` or `datetime`.
*   The `orders` table has a column `order_total` of type `decimal` or `float`.
*   The `customers` table has a column `customer_name` of type `varchar`.
*   The `products` table has a column `quantity` of type `int`.

**Note**
----

These queries assume that the database schema is as described above. You may need to modify the queries to fit your actual database schema. Additionally, these queries do not include any error handling or security measures, so you should modify them to fit your specific use case.
